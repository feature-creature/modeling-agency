# Interagency

This work examines the extent to which the notion of agency can be extended to nonhuman entities, and to computational entities in particular. Adopting a pragmatic orientation, we consider agency foremost as a discursive practice. We ask what it is that humans are doing when attributing agency to nonhumans, and whether such a practice can exist in the absence of human participants.
